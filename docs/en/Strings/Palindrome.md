# Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or sequence of words that reads the same backward as forward. Punctuation and spaces between the words or lettering is allowed.

## Steps
### Step 1
Reverse string.
### Step 2
Compare the reversed string to the original string, if they are equal this mean that string is palindrome.

## Example

### Single Word Palindromes
- Civic
- Level
- Madam

### Multiple Word Palindromes
- Don't nod.
- I did, did I?
- My gym
